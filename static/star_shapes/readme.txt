The SVGs in here will be available as rating 'star shapes' under _manage services_.

If you want to add more, it is best to choose a simple squarish-ratio file that is a flat colour on transparent background.

You can add the svgs to this folder, but it is better to add them to a folder at db_dir/static/star_shapes. Check the help files for 'custom assets' for more info.
