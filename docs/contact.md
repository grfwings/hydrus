# contact and links

I welcome all your bug reports, questions, ideas, and comments. It is always interesting to see how other people are using my software and what does and does not work for them. Most of the changes every week are suggested by users. If you are a newer user, I would love to know, once you feel more comfortable with things, how you found the learning process--keeping the help updated and UI easy to use for new users is a constant battle.

You can contact me through any of the links below except Github, where I am not active at all. Please know that I do not use social media much, but I try to respond to all pings every Saturday.

The [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus/issues) was turned off for some time, as it did not fit my workflow and I could not keep up, but it is now running again, managed by a team of volunteer users. Please feel free to submit feature requests there if you are comfortable with Github.

I am on the discord on Saturday afternoon, USA time, if you would like to talk live, and briefly on Wednesday after I put the release out. If that is not a good time for you, please leave me a DM and I will get to you when I can. There are also plenty of other hydrus users who idle who can help with support questions.

If you are waiting too long for a reply, or I said I was going to work on something you care about and seem to have forgotten, please nudge me.

I am always overwhelmed by my work to-do list. This is not to say that I do not enjoy just hanging out or talking about possible new features, but forgive me if I cannot get to a particular idea quickly. In the same way, if you encounter actual traceback-raising errors or crashes, there is only one guy to fix it, so I prefer to know ASAP with a ping so I can prioritise.

I work by myself because I have acute difficulty working with others on long-term engineering projects. Please do not spontaneously write long design documents or prepare pull requests for me--I find it more stressful than helpful, every time, and I won't be able to give it the attention it deserves. If you would like to contribute time to hydrus, you might like to help with the user repository or help guides, or, if you can program, you might like to think about something that can plug into the Client API.
